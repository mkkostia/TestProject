As noted in Chapter 1, "Agile Project Management Defined," aside from
Serum, agile methodologies do not clearly define the role of the project
manager. Perhaps this lack of clarity arises from the fact that there is no
common agreement in the industry as to what the title "project manager"
means. I have seen it used variously to both include and exclude functions
such as technical architecture, development process management, staffing,
project administration, change management, performance appraisal, project
tracking, accounting, and budgeting. Despite this variance, it has been my
experience that project managers-defined as those individuals responsible
for building and leading teams and accountable for their success or failureplay
a pivotal role in the delivery of business value. This chapter introduces a
role for such an individual-the agile manager-who is accountable for delivering
business value on projects that employ agile software development
methodologies. It also explores what this role requires in terms of underlying
values and skills.
